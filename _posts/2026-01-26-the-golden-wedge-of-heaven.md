In the vast, sprawling annals of human storytelling, there is one figure who stands at the very beginning: the "Ur-Hero."  Long before the Odyssey or the Knights of the Round Table, there was the King of Uruk. Predating the Homeric epics by over a millennium, Gilgamesh represents humanity’s very first attempt to grapple with the terrifying and beautiful concepts of mortality, legacy, and the divine right of kings.

However, if you mention the name "Gilgamesh" today, you are likely to get two very different reactions. To historians and literary scholars, he is the tragic, introspective figure of Sumerian poetry. Yet, to the millions of pop culture enthusiasts—specifically fans of the *Fate* franchise—he is the "King of Heroes," a golden-armored demigod who rains swords from the heavens and dismisses his foes as "mongrels."

This duality is not a contradiction; it is an evolution. This post serves as an exhaustive examination of Gilgamesh’s characterisation, tracing his trajectory from the cuneiform tablets of Mesopotamia to his complex incarnations in Japanese visual novels. By analyzing his psychology, his relationships, and his role as the "wedge" between gods and men, we uncover why this ancient despot remains a compelling figure of grandeur in the modern era.

## Part I: The DNA of a Legend – The Historical and Mythological Foundation

To understand the arrogance and the tragedy of the modern Gilgamesh, we must first dissect the source material: the *Epic of Gilgamesh*. This ancient text provides the DNA for every subsequent iteration, establishing the core tension between divine power and human mortality.

### The Mathematics of Divinity

The historical Gilgamesh was likely a real king of the city-state of Uruk during the Early Dynastic II period (ca. 2700-2500 BCE). The Sumerian King List credits him with a reign of 126 years and the construction of Uruk’s great walls. But it was the literary epic, standardised by the scribe Sîn-lēqi-unninni around 1200 BCE, that defined his nature.

The text presents Gilgamesh as a being who is "two-thirds god and one-third man."  This precise mathematical division is the linchpin of his character. It renders him superior to all other men, yet he remains fatally flawed by the one-third of him that is mortal. He is a being of infinite potential trapped in a finite existence.

Initially, this imbalance manifests as tyranny. The young Gilgamesh is a force of nature that civilisation cannot contain; he oppresses the men of Uruk and claims *droit du seigneur* over the women. He is restless, destructive, and lonely in his superiority.

### Enkidu: The Mirror of the Soul

The gods’ solution to the "Gilgamesh problem" was not to destroy him, but to balance him. They created Enkidu from clay—a wild man living in harmony with beasts, ignorant of civilisation. If Gilgamesh represents the constructed world of the city, Enkidu represents the raw natural world.

Their meeting results in a wrestling match in the streets of Uruk, a pivotal moment in mythology. They fight to a standstill. In that stalemate, Gilgamesh finds the one thing his absolute power had always denied him: an equal.

The relationship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu forms the emotional core of the epic. While scholars have debated its nature, ranging from brotherhood to romance, textual evidence supports deep intimacy; Gilgamesh’s mother, Ninsun, even interprets his dreams of Enkidu as loving him "like a wife." Regardless of the label, Enkidu functions as the "rational" check on Gilgamesh’s "irrational" energy. He pulls the King out of his solipsistic isolation, teaching him that "no man is an island."

### The Philosophical Triumph of Failure

The death of Enkidu is the catalyst that transforms Gilgamesh from a hero into a philosopher. Seeing his friend turn to clay, Gilgamesh is seized by the terror of his own death. He abandons his throne to wander the wilderness in animal skins, seeking Utnapishtim, the only human granted immortality.

In literal terms, his quest is a failure. He fails the gods' tests (he cannot even stay awake for a week) and loses the plant of rejuvenation to a snake. However, this failure is a philosophical triumph. Upon returning to Uruk empty-handed, he sees the walls of his city and realises that true immortality lies in legacy—the civilisation he built and the story carved on lapis lazuli tablets. He transitions from a tyrant who consumes his people to a "Wise King" who protects them.

## Part II: The King of Heroes – Gilgamesh in the *Fate* Universe

While the myth provides the tragedy, Type-Moon’s *Fate* franchise offers the most robust and complex exploration of Gilgamesh in modern media. Here, he is not merely a strong warrior; he is the "King of Heroes," the original template from which all other heroic myths are derived.

### Concept and Ontology: The Original and the Fakers

In the *Fate* lore (the Nasuverse), Gilgamesh is the oldest "Heroic Spirit." His primary weapon, or Noble Phantasm, is the *Gate of Babylon*, a vault containing the prototypes of every legendary weapon that would later appear in human history.

For example, he possesses the original sword of selection that later became Caliburn/Excalibur in Arthurian legend, and the original lance that became Gae Bolg in Irish myth. This conceptual ownership defines his arrogance. He views all other heroes as "fakers" or "mongrels" (*Zasshu*), because they are merely borrowing his treasures.

This version of Gilgamesh is split into two distinct archetypes within the franchise:

* **Archer (*Fate/Zero*, *Fate/stay night*):** The "King of Heroes." Chaotic Good (by his own definition), wielding overwhelming force via the Gate of Babylon and the sword Ea. His core philosophy is, "All things in this world are mine."
* **Caster (*Fate/Grand Order: Babylonia*):** The "Wise King of Uruk." Lawful Good, acting as a tactician and support. His core philosophy shifts to, "I will protect the legacy of humanity."

### *Fate/Zero*: The Judge of Kings

In *Fate/Zero*, Gilgamesh appears as the "Golden Youth"—arrogant, bored, and seeking amusement. He acts as a fascinating foil to the other kings in the war, specifically Iskandar (Rider) and Artoria Pendragon (Saber).

#### The Banquet of Kings

The dialogue between these three monarchs is a philosophical centrepiece of the series. They debate the nature of kingship:

* **Artoria (The Knight King):** Believes a king must serve the people, sacrificing the self for the greater good. Gilgamesh finds this pitiful, viewing her self-denial as a rejection of the humanity she claims to protect.
* **Iskandar (The King of Conquerors):** Believes a king must embody the greed and ambition of the people, leading by example. Gilgamesh respects Iskandar because his ambition is vast enough to be entertaining, acknowledging him as a worthy rival.
* **Gilgamesh (The King of Heroes):** Asserts that the king *is* the state. He does not serve the people; the people prosper simply by existing in his garden. His rule is absolute, and his judgment is final.

#### The Corruption of Kirei and the Mercy for Waver

Gilgamesh’s most significant relationship in *Fate/Zero* is with the antagonist, Kirei Kotomine. Recognizing Kirei’s suppressed sadism and existential emptiness, Gilgamesh acts as a dark mentor, encouraging Kirei to embrace "pleasure" to understand his own soul. Gilgamesh isn't "evil" in a chaotic sense here; he values "gleaming souls" and authenticity above all else. He guides Kirei toward villainy because that is Kirei’s "true" nature.

Conversely, the conclusion of *Fate/Zero* shows his code of honor. After killing Iskandar in single combat—using his strongest weapon, Ea, out of respect—Gilgamesh confronts Waver Velvet, Iskandar’s weak Master. When Waver refuses to step aside, citing loyalty to his fallen king, Gilgamesh spares him. He tells Waver, "Your loyalty is splendid. Never tarnish it." This proves Gilgamesh is not a mindless murderer; he respects conviction and strength of character, even in the weak.

### *Fate/stay night*: The Antagonist of the Modern World

In the Fifth Holy Grail War, Gilgamesh appears as the primary antagonist. Having lived in the modern world for ten years, he is disgusted by modern humanity, viewing them as "useless" consumers who have forgotten their purpose. He seeks to use the Holy Grail to "prune" humanity, allowing only those with strong souls to survive the chaos.

The conflict between Gilgamesh and the protagonist Shirou Emiya in the *Unlimited Blade Works* route is a thematic clash of "Original vs. Copy." Gilgamesh possesses the original treasures, while Shirou can only create copies via projection magic. However, Shirou’s Reality Marble is the natural counter to the Gate of Babylon. While Gilgamesh must open a portal to retrieve a weapon, Shirou’s weapons already exist within his reality, allowing him to strike faster.

Ultimately, Gilgamesh loses not due to a lack of power, but due to hubris. He refuses to take a "Faker" seriously, hesitating to draw Ea until it is too late. His ego prevents him from acknowledging threats he deems beneath him—a fatal flaw.

### *Fate/Grand Order*: The Wise King Returns

If *Fate/Zero* depicts the arrogant youth, *Fate/Grand Order* (FGO) introduces Caster Gilgamesh, the Wise King who has returned from his quest for immortality. This version is widely considered the most nuanced and "heroic" iteration.

In the Babylonia chapter, Gilgamesh rules a Uruk under siege. Unlike his Archer self, Caster Gilgamesh seals away Ea and fights with magical staves to better lead his people. He is defined by responsibility and overwork; he literally works himself to death managing the city's defense and resources.

He adopts a mentorship role toward the protagonist Ritsuka and the demi-servant Mash. While he retains a "tsundere" nature—claiming to act only for amusement—his actions betray a deep love for humanity.

The climax of his character arc occurs in his speech to the survivors of Uruk. He declares the end of the Age of Gods and the beginning of the Age of Man. He frames mortality not as a weakness, but as the source of human strength—the drive to create a future *because* one’s own time is limited. This is the ultimate realisation of *Sha naqba īmuru* (He Who Saw the Deep): humanity does not need gods to define its value.

### *Fate/strange Fake*: The True Reunion

In *Fate/strange Fake*, Gilgamesh is reunited with Enkidu, who is also summoned as a Servant. The presence of Enkidu strips away Gilgamesh's boredom and malice, reverting him to a "childlike" joy. Their battle in the desert reshapes the landscape, yet it is fundamentally a "playful" reunion between friends. Enkidu is the only being who can force Gilgamesh to use Ea immediately and go all out without hesitation.

Furthermore, his relationship with his Master, Tine Chelc, shows his nurturing side. He sees potential in her desire to reclaim her land and offers her the Potion of Youth. This reinforces that Gilgamesh’s cruelty is reserved for the "stagnant," while he supports the "striving."

## Part III: The Rift Wanderer – Gilgamesh in *Final Fantasy*

While *Fate* treats Gilgamesh with mythological gravitas, the *Final Fantasy* franchise reinterprets him as a tragicomic, dimension-hopping wanderer. This version serves as a meta-commentary on the series itself.

### The Battle on the Big Bridge

Debuting in *Final Fantasy V*, Gilgamesh starts as a lieutenant of the villain Exdeath. He is famous for fighting the party on the "Big Bridge," a setting that has become his musical and thematic signature. In the climax, he sacrifices himself to save the party, dragging an enemy into the "Interdimensional Rift." This banishment is the Watsonian explanation for his appearances in all other *Final Fantasy* titles: he is literally lost in the space between dimensions, searching for a way home.

### The Weapon Collector

In subsequent games, Gilgamesh is defined by his obsession with collecting legendary weapons, most notably Excalibur. However, a recurring gag involves him being duped into finding the *Excalipoor*, a counterfeit sword that deals only 1 damage.

* In *Final Fantasy XII*, he wields counterfeits of legendary swords from other games (like Cloud’s Buster Sword), establishing his awareness of the multiverse.

* In *Final Fantasy VIII*, his entrance is legendary. He doesn't just appear; he arrives during the battle with Seifer to replace the summon Odin, who is shockingly cut down by the antagonist. Gilgamesh catches Odin's falling sword, the Zantetsuken, and from that point on functions as a random summon. True to his chaotic nature, he cycles through four different swords—including the joke weapon Excalipoor—meaning he might decimate your enemies with Odin's blade or annoy them with a 1-damage strike.

### Final Fantasy VII Rebirth: The Genji Warrior

In the recent *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth*, Gilgamesh appears as a superboss on "Gilgamesh Island." The game leans heavily into his lore as a rift wanderer. If the player allows him to count down during his ultimate attack, he breaks the fourth wall: "Say farewell to your dreams, and behold your Final Fantasy." He wields the "Busted Sword" and "Massy Moony" (replicas of the Buster Sword and Masamune), continuing his tradition of using knock-off weapons. His motivation remains the collection of Genji armor to restore his power, hinting at a desire to return to his "friend" (Bartz/Enkidu).

## Part IV: Comparative Analysis and the "Why"

The endurance of Gilgamesh across millennia speaks to the malleability of his archetype. By comparing the original myth to his modern incarnations, we can see how cultural values have shifted.

### The Agency of the King

A critical divergence lies in the handling of the Herb of Immortality. In the original myth, the snake stealing the herb is a tragedy that forces Gilgamesh to accept mortality. In *Fate*, however, it is revealed that Gilgamesh retrieved the herb again (or had the means to) but *chose* not to use it. He decides that an eternal body is unworthy of his duty to oversee the changing eras of humanity. He allows the snake to eat it to shed his attachment to the past. This shifts his character from a victim of fate to an agent of free will, aligning with the modern preference for proactive protagonists.

### Antagonist vs. Villain

In *Fate*, Gilgamesh is frequently an antagonist but rarely a traditional villain. A villain seeks destruction for malice or personal gain. Gilgamesh seeks destruction to "cleanse" his garden. His motivation is rooted in a twisted form of love; he despises what humanity has become (weak, aimless), because he remembers what it once was (vibrant, striving). This "tough love" philosophy makes him a compelling figure, as his critiques of modern society often resonate with the audience's own cynicisms.

### Summary Comparison Table

To visualise these differences, we can look at the core attributes across his iterations:

| Feature | Sumerian Myth (Epic) | Fate Franchise (Nasuverse) | Final Fantasy / Gaming |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Goal** | Immortality (Eternal Life)  | Amusement / Preservation of Human Worth  | Collection of Weapons / Returning Home  |
| **Role of Enkidu** | Wild man who civilises the King  | Divine Weapon/Soulmate who balances the King  | Faithful Companion (often dog/demon)  |
| **Stance on Humanity** | Oppressor turned Protector  | Judge / Gardener (Pruning the weak)  | Wanderer / Challenger  |
| **Relationship to Gods** | Victim / Rebel  | Rebel / Atheist (Rejects Divine Authority)  | Minion (initially) / Independent Agent  |

### Conclusion: The Star of the Beginning

Why does Gilgamesh endure? Why does a Bronze-Age tyrant hold such sway over the digital age?

The answer lies in what he represents: the maximalist human experience. Gilgamesh is the *id* of humanity unchained. He desires everything, owns everything, and fears nothing (save death, which he eventually conquers psychologically). In a modern world defined by compromise and moderation, Gilgamesh’s absolute confidence is intoxicating. He is the "Gold" of the human spirit—shining, heavy, and immutable.

In *Fate*, he serves as the ultimate litmus test for heroism. Characters like Shirou Emiya and Artoria Pendragon must define their ideals against the crushing weight of Gilgamesh’s ego. He is the wall against which they must throw themselves to prove their worth. When he sneers "Zasshu," it is not merely an insult; it is a challenge: Prove to me that your existence has meaning. Prove to me that you are worthy of the life I was denied.

In *Final Fantasy*, he represents the joy of the journey. He is the eternal adventurer, hopping between worlds and reminding players that even the most legendary figures can be fools, and that bonds of friendship transcend dimensions.

Ultimately, Gilgamesh is the "Wedge of Heaven"—the pin that holds the divine and the mundane together. He starts as a god who despises men and ends as a man who rejects gods. His journey from the Cedar Forest to the Throne of Heroes is the story of humanity growing up, stepping out of the shadow of the divine, and learning to walk on its own two feet.
