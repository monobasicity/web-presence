We live in an unprecedented era where trillion-dollar companies compete for our eyeballs. Every notification, every infinite scroll, every autoplay video is engineered to capture and hold attention.

## The Cost of Distraction

What do we lose when our attention is fragmented?

- **Deep thinking** requires uninterrupted focus
- **Meaningful relationships** need presence
- **Creative work** demands flow states
- **Inner peace** requires stillness

Yet we voluntarily carry devices designed to prevent all of these.

## The Philosophical Question

Is our attention the most valuable thing we possess? If so, why do we give it away so freely?

Seneca wrote about the scarcity of time two thousand years ago. Today, time isn't just scarce—it's actively being stolen.

## A Path Forward

Digital minimalism isn't about rejecting technology. It's about intentionality.

- **Audit** your digital tools
- **Question** each app's presence on your phone
- **Protect** blocks of distraction-free time
- **Embrace** boredom as a feature, not a bug

The goal isn't productivity. It's presence.

## A Personal Note

I deleted social media from my phone last month. The first week was uncomfortable. By the third week, I had read four books and reconnected with three old friends in person.

The attention economy only works if we keep paying.
