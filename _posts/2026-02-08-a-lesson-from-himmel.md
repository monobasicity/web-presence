Sometimes art resonates so deeply it forces you to stop. Music, books, games, films—they all have the capacity to make you think thoughts you otherwise wouldn’t. But recently, it was anime that cut through the noise for me.

I was watching a recent episode of *Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End* when a specific line stopped me in my tracks. A thought so deeply buried I realised I probably hadn’t accessed it in years.

Hero Himmel says: **"Even if things don’t go as you’d hoped, you can still enjoy the process."**

It sounds simple, almost trite, but it resonated so profoundly that I had to pause the episode just to write it down. It forced me to ask a difficult question: "Am I enjoying anything?"

Am I doing anything other than producing results and beating myself up over failures? Is the reason I struggle to find enjoyment in things I used to love—gaming, creating, learning—because I have lost the "joy of the process"?

### The Internal Accounting System
Modern society, and especially modern achievement culture, trains us to evaluate ourselves almost exclusively through outputs: results, milestones, metrics, and proof. Enjoyment has become conditional. We are taught that we are allowed to feel good only *after* we succeed, *after* something is finished, *after* the time spent can be justified.

The process itself becomes invisible. Worse, it becomes a burden we must endure to earn the right to rest.

Over time, this mindset does something subtle but corrosive to us:
* **Activities become means:** Things we once loved become mere steps to an end rather than experiences in themselves.
* **Failure becomes an indictment:** It doesn’t just disappoint; it attacks our sense of worth.
* **Success feels thin:** Even when we win, the bar is immediately raised.

I’ve begun to suspect that my "internal accounting system" no longer recognises joy unless it is validated by a deliverable outcome.

### Refusing the Productivity Arc
This is why *Frieren* hit so hard. The show refuses to treat life as a productivity arc. Himmel’s statement doesn’t deny the pain of disappointment or failure. It simply rejects the idea that meaning is retroactively granted only by success.

The process wasn’t a waste just because the ending wasn’t ideal. **It mattered while it was happening.**

I’ve been wondering if this realisation is the "cure" to my inability to enjoy my hobbies. Perhaps it’s not a sudden cure, but a necessary reorientation of value. You cannot simply stop caring about outcomes—consequences matter, and reality doesn’t disappear just because we try to be present.

But the shift might be this:
> **Outcomes inform your life.**\
> **Processes define your experience of it.**

We tend to collapse these two into one, and as a result, we end up inhabiting neither.

### The Self on Trial
When our self-evaluation is entirely outcome-based, three things almost inevitably happen:
1. **Attention leaves the present.** My mind is always ahead of my body—judging, forecasting, comparing. Even while doing something, my thoughts are already at the finish line, asking whether this effort will "count."
2. **The process is instrumentalised.** I stop experiencing the activity; I just endure it. Even hobbies are evaluated for efficiency, optimisation, or output.
3. **Worth becomes volatile.** Success brings relief, not peace. Failure brings self-recrimination, not learning.

In this state, **I am what’s on trial.**

This feeds directly into the "impostor syndrome" so many of us feel. There are two fundamentally different questions a person can ask after making an effort:
* **The Reality Question:** "Did this work?"
* **The Self-Worth Question:** "What does this say about me?"

When outcomes measure the self, every result becomes evidence in an ongoing, invisible court case about who I am. This destroys presence. I am not doing an activity; I am testifying. My attention fractures, because part of me is acting, part of me is judging, and part of me is anticipating the judgment of others.

### From Self-Prosecution to Accountability
Releasing self-measurement from outcomes changes that dynamic. Not because outcomes stop existing, but because they stop being proxies for my value.

This is where being "in the here and now" stops sounding like a vague mindfulness cliché and becomes concrete. The present is the only place where process can be felt. The future is where outcomes live. **If your worth is decided in the future, your life never quite arrives.**

Enjoying the process isn’t about forcing positivity. It’s about allowing what is happening to be legitimate even if it doesn’t justify itself later. That includes boredom, friction, false starts, and yes, failure.

In *Frieren*, the story isn’t about peak moments—it’s about retrospective meaning. Frieren realises that the experiences she dismissed as merely "passing time" were, in fact, her life. Himmel grasped that while he was living it.

So, is this perspective what "cures" life?

I don’t think life needs curing. It needs to be relieved of a distortion: the idea that you must justify your existence through results. We need to distinguish between accountability and self-prosecution.
* **Accountability**: "This didn't work. Why did it fail? What can be done to succeed? What can be adjusted?"
* **Self-prosecution**: "This didn't work. Why did *I* fail? What's wrong with me? Am I not good enough?"

When we stop measuring ourselves by outcomes, everything doesn’t magically become joyful. However, effort becomes honest engagement; failure becomes survivable feedback; results become information, and moments once more stop needing permission to matter.

That doesn’t fix everything. But it makes living possible again.
