I turned 30 last week. The world didn't end. Here's what I've figured out so far (or at least, what I think I've figured out).

## Things That Matter Less Than I Thought

- **Others' opinions** — Most people are too busy worrying about themselves
- **Having it all figured out** — Nobody does, and that's fine
- **Being productive 24/7** — Rest is not a reward; it's a requirement
- **Winning arguments** — Being right feels empty if it costs a relationship

## Things That Matter More Than I Expected

- **Sleep** — 8 hours is non-negotiable now
- **Boring consistency** — Small habits compound into significant change
- **Saying no** — Protecting your time is protecting your life
- **Being present** — The past is gone, the future uncertain. Now is all we have.

## Unexpected Joys

- Staying in on Friday night
- Gardening (yes, really)
- Writing letters by hand
- Long conversations with nothing to do after

## A Note to Younger Me

You'll figure it out. Not all at once, and not in the way you expect. But you'll figure it out.

The anxiety you feel about the future? It mostly doesn't come true. And the things that do happen—good and bad—shape you into someone you wouldn't recognize right now.

Trust the process. Be kind to yourself. Show up consistently.

## Looking Forward

Thirty feels like the beginning of something, not the end. I'm more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever been.

Here's to the next decade. May it be filled with growth, connection, and plenty of interesting mistakes.
