I finally did it. After 200 hours, countless deaths, and three broken controllers (just kidding... mostly), I've completed Elden Ring.

## More Than a Game

FromSoftware titles are famous for their difficulty. But Elden Ring is more than hard—it's a meditation on perseverance.

Every boss that seemed impossible eventually fell. Every area that felt insurmountable was conquered. The game taught me that progress isn't always linear, and that's okay.

## Standout Moments

**Margit, the Fell Omen** — My first real wall. Took 47 attempts. That moment when he finally fell? Pure euphoria.

**Rennala's Academy** — The most beautiful location in the game. I spent hours just exploring.

**Malenia** — We don't talk about Malenia. But also, yes, I eventually beat her. Solo. It took a week of my life.

## The Open World Done Right

Unlike many open-world games that feel empty, Elden Ring rewards curiosity at every turn. That cave in the distance? It has a secret boss. That cliff edge? Leads to an entire hidden area.

## Final Thoughts

Elden Ring reminded me that the best things in life require patience and persistence. It's not just a game—it's a teacher disguised as entertainment.

Rating: A masterpiece. 10/10.

Now, about that DLC...
